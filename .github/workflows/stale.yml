          stale-issue-message: |
            This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it hasn't had activity in 30 days.
            
            **What happens next:**
            - If no response in 7 days, this will auto-close
            - Comment or react to keep it open
            - Closed issues can be reopened anytime
            
            This helps me focus on active issues. Thanks for understanding! 🙏
          
          close-issue-message: |
